<h2 id="addSale">Make a Sale</h2>
<p>Sales can be made by selecting <em>"Add sale"</em> from the <em>"Sales"</em> drop down menu.</p>
<img src="doc/addSale.JPG" />
<p>This is the primary component of the software through which sales can be made. When items are scanned in, they will appear in the table at the borrom, or items can be manually entered in. If items are to be entered manually, <strong>make sure to enter all information</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Product id</li>
<li>Product name</li>
<li>Quantity of the product included in the sale</li>
<li>The price of a single unit of the product</li>
</ol>
<p>There is also a space to enter the customer's name.&nbsp;<strong>Always ask the customer for their name</strong> but do not force them to give it. The customer's name is helpful for record keeping but not mandatory.</p>
<p>Once the sale is completed select <em>"Save and Proceed"</em> to complete the purchase. Once the sale has been confirmed, the page will load again so that another sale can be processed.</p>
<p>Selecting <em>"Close"</em> will cancel the sale and information will not be saved.</p>
